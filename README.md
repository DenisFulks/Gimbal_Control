# Gimbal_Control
Open source control system for Gimbal Unit based on the paper "3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system for optoelectronic measurements"

Currently works only off one controller.

The main "Gimbal" File is the fastest but allows for some wobble during movement.
"Gimbal_No_Wobble" slows down the gimbal to 1 step per cycle but eliminates most if not all of the wobble.
